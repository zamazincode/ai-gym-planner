Generate a complete training plan in JSON format with this exact structure:

    "goal": "brief description of the training goal",
    "frequency": "X days per week",
    "split": "training split name",

  Requirements:
  - Create exactly ${profile.days_per_week} workout days
  - Each workout should fit within ${profile.session_length} minutes
  - Include 4-6 exercises per workout
  - RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) should be 6-9
  - Include compound movements for beginners/intermediate, advanced can have more isolation
  - Match the preferred split type: ${profile.preferred_split}
  - ${profile.injuries ? `Avoid exercises that could aggravate: ${profile.injuries}` : ""}
  - Provide exercise alternatives where appropriate
  - Make it progressive and suitable for ${experienceMap[profile.experience] || profile.experience} level
  
  Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no extra text).
